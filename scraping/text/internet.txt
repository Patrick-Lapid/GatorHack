Have questions? Weve got answers.
Where is Verizon Home Internet available? And what home internet services are available to me?
It's all about the internet technology, how its delivered to your home and where you live. Fios Home Internet is widely available in metro and suburban areas of New England and the Mid-Atlantic. 5G Home Internet is now in more and more cities around the country. Since LTE Home Internet uses the wireless 4G LTE network to deliver home broadband internet service, it is available in most parts of the country where Fios and 5G Home Internet are not available.
To see which Verizon Home Internet service is available where you live, click here.
What is 5G Home Internet?
5G Home Internet is fast, reliable home internet powered by 5G Ultra Wideband, so you can game, stream and connect the way you want.
5G Ultra Wideband is now in more and more places around the country, so more people than ever can experience Verizon's exceptional broadband internet at home.
To learn what home internet is available at your address, check availability.
What is Fios Internet?
Fios Internet is a 100% fiber-optic network that delivers some of the fastest internet speeds to millions of homes in the mid-Atlantic and New England. It uses fiber optics to transmit data at the speed of light, providing a fast internet connection and powerful bandwidth for multiple devices. Verizon is one of the only internet service providers to offer matching download and upload speeds on most of our plans, which is a major advantage when youre video chatting, gaming and sharing large files or images.
What is LTE Home Internet?
LTE Home Internet is home broadband internet service that brings the Verizon 4G LTE network to your residence. It is available in certain areas where there are no other Verizon broadband options (Fios, 5G Home, etc.). With LTE Home Internet, you can stream video at 1080p, plus you can enjoy unlimited data with no data usage caps.
Does Verizon Home Internet participate in the Affordable Connectivity Program?
Yes. The ACP is a federal program that provides subsidized internet service for eligible customers. ACP qualified customers can get:
Up to one $30/month subsidy for each eligible household
Up to one $75/month subsidy for each eligible household on Tribal lands
If you qualify for ACP, the subsidy can be applied to Verizon Home Internet plans. Both new and existing customers can take advantage of it. Learn more
Can Verizon help cover my early termination fee when I switch to Verizon Home Internet?
Yes! If you are stuck in a contract for home internet, switch to Verizon Home Internet and get up to $500 credit to help cover your early termination fee. If you're eligible to get a bill credit for up to $500 for an early termination fee charged by your previous home internet provider, here's how to get it. If you order Fios home internet, see the Fios Early Termination Fee instructions. If you order 5G Home, go to the 5G Home Internet bill credit page.
You must submit your request within 90 days of your Verizon Home Internet setup.
Can I transfer my current Verizon Home Internet service to a new address?
We make it easy to stay connected. Check out our page on moving Verizon Home Internet service or log into your account to get started.

You must return all Verizon-owned equipment w/in 30 days of cancellation; refund will be issued 30-60 days after equipment return. Limit of one credit on one eligible address on your account. Early Termination Fees: For new Verizon Home Internet customers who terminated their prior internet service and incurred an early termination fee (ETF) within the last 4 months.

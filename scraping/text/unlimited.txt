Have questions? Weve got answers.
Can I keep my current Verizon wireless plan?
Yes, users with an existing plan can keep their current plan. However, if you're on an existing Mix & Match or Welcome Unlimited plan you can choose to switch one or all of your lines to myPlan at any time. All other plans must switch all of their lines if moving to myPlan.
What are the differences between Unlimited Ultimate, Unlimited Plus and Unlimited Welcome?
All of Verizon's Unlimited plans include unlimited talk, text, and data, as well as 5G (or 4G LTE in areas where 5G isn't available), Mexico and Canada talk, text and data, as well as International texting. With Unlimited Plus, you get our fastest 5G and access to 30 GB of Premium unlimited mobile hotspot data per month to power your other devices on the go. Unlimited Ultimate offers 60 GB premium hotspot data and unlimited calling and texting from 200+ countries. With Unlimited Ultimate you also get 10 GB international roaming data a month and the ability to turn on 1080p - 4G LTE/5G when you're streaming video. Check out our latest promotions and offers.
Can I mix and match between Unlimited Ultimate, Unlimited Plus and Unlimited Welcome?
Activating more than one line? If you'd like to choose Unlimited Ultimate or Unlimited Plus for some lines but Unlimited Welcome for others, you can do that. Just choose the plan you'd like for each specific line, for up to 12 lines, when you sign up for myPlan. Learn more.
What are the benefits of adding a perk through Verizon?
Save every month - check out the price savings on your favorite monthly subscriptions. Additionally, by adding perks to your plan through Verizon, you can manage those perks and subscriptions all in one place. For example, if you sign up for one of the available perk memberships, you can manage the membership through your Verizon bill and keep track of those charges all in one place.
Will new perks be added?
Yes keep checking back for new, updated perks. Since you aren't locked in with myPlan to any specific contract, you can add new perks or change them at any time. Just one of the many benefits of our new Unlimited plans!
What is data on a cell phone plan?
When you aren't connected to Wi-Fi, you connect to the internet using data. So, if you're logging onto the web but not connected to Wi-Fi, your phone will require a data plan. This includes while using apps that require an internet connection, such as social media apps and certain mobile games, etc.
What is an unlimited data plan?
Some cell phone plans limit the amount of data you can use per month (measured in gigabytes, or "GB"), while an unlimited data plan doesn't limit you. It's an unlimited number of GBs. Depending on which plan you select, your speeds may be slower in times of congestion. Review your plan for details.
What happens if I already have a subscription to a perk?
It depends on the perk and the current subscription you have. You may need to manage your existing subscription to activate a perk. Please see the specific perk FAQs on what happens with existing subscriptions: Disney Bundle, Apple One, Apple Music, Walmart+, 2 TB Cloud Storage, Smartwatch Data & Safety and Three TravelPass Days perk FAQs.

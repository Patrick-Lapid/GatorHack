However if you're on an existing Mix & Match or Welcome Unlimited plan you can choose to switch one or all of your lines to myPlan at any time. All other plans must switch all of their lines if moving to myPlan. What are the differences between Unlimited Ultimate Unlimited Plus and Unlimited Welcome? All of Verizon's Unlimited plans include unlimited talk text and data as well as 5G (or 4G LTE in areas where 5G isn't available) Mexico and Canada talk text and data as well as International texting.

Save every month - check out the price savings on your favorite monthly subscriptions. Additionally by adding perks to your plan through Verizon you can manage those perks and subscriptions all in one place. For example if you sign up for one of the available perk memberships you can manage the membership through your Verizon bill and keep track of those charges all in one place. Will new perks be added? Yes keep checking back for new updated perks. Since you aren't locked in with myPlan to any specific contract you can add new perks or change them at any time. Just one of the many benefits of our new Unlimited plans! What is data on a cell phone plan? When you aren't connected to Wi-Fi you connect to the internet using data. So if you're logging onto the web but not connected to Wi-Fi your phone will require a data plan. This includes while using apps that require an internet connection such as social media apps and certain mobile games etc. What is an unlimited data plan? Some cell phone plans limit the amount of data you can use per month (measured in gigabytes or ""GB"") while an unlimited data plan doesn't limit you. It's an unlimited number of GBs. Depending on which plan you select your speeds may be slower in times of congestion. Review your plan for details. What happens if I already have a subscription to a perk? It depends on the perk and the current subscription you have. You may need to manage your existing subscription to activate a perk. Please see the specific perk FAQs on what happens with existing subscriptions: Disney Bundle Apple One Apple Music Walmart+ 2 TB Cloud Storage Smartwatch Data & Safety and Three TravelPass Days perk FAQs.

# University of Florida Gator Hackathon - GatorHack Submission

Horizon Veritas is a Proof-Of-Concept, showcasing the potential of a perfect blend of chat and browsing. Positioned at the bottom of your screen, it provides semantic search and semantic-based actions. Horizon Veritas caches web page content and their respective embeddings. Upon a user's query, it performs:

* Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG): Providing answers with enhanced context.
* Intent Extraction: Identifying user intent through vector embedding similarity, allowing for various actions like selection, filtering, and more.

Technologies Used:

* Frontend: Chrome Extension built with ReactJS.
* Middleware: Python, WebSocket.
* Backend: Large Language Models (LLMs), including ADA-002 Embeddings Model, GPT 3.5 Turbo 4K, 16K, GPT 3.5 Turbo Instruct, GPT Function Calling, and Python.
* Databases: Pinecone Vector Database for efficient embedding search.
